## 📘 What Is Temporary Email?

**Temporary email** (also known as *disposable*, *burner*, or *throwaway email*) is a short-lived email address created to receive messages **without exposing your real inbox**.

It is designed for:
- Privacy-preserving signups  
- One-time verifications  
- Testing & trials  
- Spam prevention  

Messages arrive in a **live inbox** and are **automatically deleted** after a short time.

## 🔍 How Temporary Email Works

Temporary email systems follow a simple privacy-first flow:

1. Address is generated instantly  
2. Inbox opens in the browser  
3. Emails arrive in real time  
4. Messages auto-delete after expiry  

✔ No login  
✔ No personal data  
✔ Minimal digital footprint

## 🛡️ How Temporary Email Protects Your Privacy

Disposable email protects privacy by **breaking the link** between you and online services.

### Key Privacy Benefits

- ❌ No long-term tracking
- ❌ No marketing profile building
- ✔ Reduced data resale risk

⚠️ Important: Temporary email is **not meant for account recovery or MFA-critical accounts**.

## 🔄 Temporary Email vs Regular Email (Quick Comparison)

| Email Type | Lifespan | Best Use Case |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| Temporary Email | Short-lived | Trials, testing, anonymous signups |
| Email Alias | Persistent | Newsletter control & filtering |
| Regular Email | Permanent | Banking, government, business |

💡 **Best strategy:**  
Use **temporary email for throwaway actions** and **regular email for long-term accounts**.

---

## 🧠 Temporary Email vs Email Aliases

- **Email aliases** forward to your main inbox and support recovery  
- **Temporary emails** disappear and leave no trace  

👉 Ask yourself:  
**“Will I need this email later?”**  
- Yes → Alias / Regular email  
- No → Temporary email
